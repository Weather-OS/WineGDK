Wine's Microsoft Game Development Kit Implementation

This consists of a library called `xgameruntime.dll`.
Most GDK games only rely on this library and wouldn't use anything else for GDK API.

Our GDK implementation here does NOT include functionality that's under NDA.
Fortunately, this does not tend to affect GDK games published for Microsoft® Windows, and
is mostly exclusive to the Microsoft® Xbox console.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT OR STUB ANY FUNCTIONALITY THAT'S UNDER AN NDA.
